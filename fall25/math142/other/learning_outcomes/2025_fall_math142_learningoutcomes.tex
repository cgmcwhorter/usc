\section*{10/14, Tuesday: Alternating Series Test \& Conditional Convergence\label{10-14}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Know that an alternating series is a series of the form $\ds\sum^\infty (-1)^n a_n$, where $\{ a_n \}$ is a sequence with $a_n > 0$. That is, an alternating series is a series whose terms alternate sign. 

\item Know that the Comparison Tests \textit{do not} apply to alternating series.

\item Be able to understand, state, and use the Alternating Series Test (AST): if $\ds\sum^\infty (-1)^n a_n$ is an alternating series with\dots
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n= 0$
	\item $\{ a_n \}$ is a decreasing sequence, i.e. $a_{n+1} \leq a_n$
	\end{itemize}
Then the series $\ds\sum^\infty (-1)^n a_n$ converges.

\item Know that the first part of the Alternating Series Test is simply the Divergence Test and that if in an alternating series $\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$, then the series diverges by the Divergence Test. [Even though we only know $\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$ and not necessarily $\ds\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} (-1)^n a_n \neq 0$. It is true that if $\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$, then $\ds\lim_{n \to \infty} (-1)^n a_n \neq 0$, so that the Divergence Test will apply.]

\item Know that to show a sequence is decreasing, one often has to use derivatives, i.e. showing the derivative is always negative, or some type of `algebraic' trick. Although, we often will not bother to \textit{prove} that the sequence is (eventually) decreasing but instead rather simply assume/state it.

\item Know that if an $\{ a_n \}$ is not necessarily decreasing (so that the Alternating Series Test does not apply), this \textit{does not} mean that the alternating series diverges----it may converge or it may diverge. For example, the alternating series given by $\dfrac{1}{2^4} - \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^4} - \dfrac{1}{3^2} + \dfrac{1}{4^4} - \dfrac{1}{4^2} + \cdots$ has terms that tend to 0 but do not decrease, e.g. $\frac{1}{2^2} \not\leq \dfrac{1}{2^4}$. Yet, this series converges. On the other hand, the series given by $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} - \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 1} - \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} + \cdots$ has terms that tend to 0 but do not decrease, e.g. the given terms are $\approx 2.41421, 0.414214, 1.36603, 0.366025, \ldots$. But this series does indeed diverge. 

\item Know that the Alternating Harmonic Series converges. In fact, $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}= \ln(2)$.

\item Know that while many alternating series have a power of $-1$, alternating series do not have to have this to be alternating---the term could be `hidden.' For example, the series $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{n \cos(\pi n)}{\ln(n + 1)}$ is alternating because the values of $\cos(\pi n)$ are either $+1$ or $-1$ depending on the value of $n$. Furthermore, just because a series has a power of $-1$ in the summand does not mean that the series alternates. For example, the series $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^n}{(-2)^n}$ \textit{does not} alternate because $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^n}{(-2)^n}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^n}{(-1)^n 2^n}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{2^n}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \dfrac{1}{2} \right)^n$, which does not alternate. 

\item Be able to know, state, and apply the Remainder Theorem for Alternating Series: if an alternating series $\ds\sum^\infty (-1)^n a_n$ converges, say to $S$, then the difference between $S$ and the sum of the first $n$ terms, $S_n$ (which is called the remainder, $R_n$) satisfies $|S_n - S|= |R_n| \leq |a_{n+1}|$. That is, the error between the actual sum of the series and the sum you get by adding the first $n$ terms is at most the magnitude of the next term you would have added/subtracted next. For instance, the series $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ converges by the Alternating Series Test (in fact, to $\ln(2)$). If we only add $1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.759524$, then the error between this value and the actual sum of the series is \textit{at most} $\left| -\frac{1}{8} \right|= \frac{1}{8}= 0.125$. In fact, $|\ln(2) - 0.759524| \approx 0.0663766 < 0.125$.

\item Be able to use the Remainder Theorem for Alternating Series to find at most how many terms of a convergent alternating series one would need to add to be within a certain error of the actual sum of the series. For instance, we know the series $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}}$ converges by the Alternating Series Test. Suppose one wanted to find the sum of this series to two decimal places, i.e. with an error less than $\pm 0.01$. If we added the first $n$ terms, the magnitude of the next term would be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}$. We know the error is at most this term. So, we could find an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}} < 0.01$. But then\dots
	\[
	\begin{gathered}
	\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}} < 0.01 \\[0.2cm]
	\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}} < \dfrac{1}{100} \\[0.2cm]
	\sqrt{n+1} > 100 \\[0.2cm]
	(\sqrt{n+1})^2 > 100^2 \\[0.2cm]
	n + 1 > 10000 \\[0.2cm]
	n > 9999
	\end{gathered}
	\]
Therefore, if we add at least the first $9,\!999+1= 10,\!000$ terms of the series (the $+1$ is because this is the next integer strictly bigger than $9,\!999$; if we had $n > 8,\!432.119$, we would have taken $n= 8,\!433$), we would approximate the actual sum to two decimal places. We may need less terms, but using this many guarantees it. 

\item Know that dropping/moving infinitely many parentheses is not necessarily a valid operation; that is, while moving finitely many parentheses is fine, e.g. $(1 + 3) - 4 + 6 + (5 - 1)= 1 + (3 - 4) + (6 + 5) - 1$, but something like $(1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + \cdots= 1 + (-1 + 1) + 1 + (-1 + 1) + \cdots$ is not necessarily (and often is not) correct. 

\item Know and be able to state the definition of absolute and conditional convergence: a series $\ds\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent (or converges absolutely) if $\ds\sum |a_n|$ also converges. If $\ds\sum a_n$ converges but the series $\ds\sum |a_n|$ diverges, then we say that the series $\ds\sum a_n$ converges conditionally (or is conditionally convergent). 

\item Know that if the series $\ds\sum |a_n|$ converges, i.e. the series $\ds\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then it must be that the series $\ds\sum a_n$ converges. In fact, if a series $\ds\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then the series created by  \textit{any} rearrangement of its terms converges and also converges to the same sum. This is called the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem.

\item Know that if a series $\ds\sum a_n$ is conditionally convergent, i.e. $\ds\sum a_n$ converges but $\ds\sum |a_n|$ diverges, then there is a series that can be formed by rearranging the terms of the series $\ds\sum a_n$ that converges to \textit{any} real number, $-\infty$, $+\infty$, or diverges. This is called the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem.

\item Be able to determine whether a given series diverges, converges conditionally, or converges absolutely and be able to provide a full justification of the answer.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\ds\sum^\infty a_n$ diverges, then $\ds\sum^\infty b_n$ diverges. 
	\item If $\ds\sum^\infty b_n$ converges, then $\ds\sum^\infty a_n$ converges.
	\end{itemize}

\item If a series is `like' a $p$-series, be able to determine which $p$-series it is `like' and use this information to predict whether the given series converges or diverges.

\item Be able to use a `number line' analogy to help determine whether one needs to increase or decrease the summand to prove the convergence/divergence of the given series with the Direct Comparison Test.

\section*{10/02, Thursday: Limit Comparison Test\label{10-02}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to compute trigonometric integrals.

\item The common techniques for trigonometric integrals depend on the case:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Products of $\sin$ \& $\cos$, $\tan$ \& $\sec$, and $\cot$ \& $\csc$: Choose $u$ and the Pythagorean identities so that the integrand can be expressed in terms of $u$ only. [One may have to convert to cosines, distribute the terms, and integrate term-by-term or convert tangents to secants and integrate powers of tangent.]
	\item Even powers of $\sin$ \& $\cos$: Convert to cosines using $\dfrac{1 \pm \cos 2x}{2}$
	\item Odd powers of $\sin$ \& $\cos$: `Pull off' a $\sin$ or $\cos$ and then perform $u$-substitution---possibly making use of the Pythagorean identities
	\item Powers of $\tan$: Pull off even powers of tangent, use the Pythagorean identities to replace the pulled off term in terms of $\sec$, FOIL/distribute, and integrate term-by-term
	\item Even powers of $\sec$: Pull off even powers of secant, use the Pythagorean identities to replace the pulled off term in terms of $\tan$, FOIL/distribute, and then integrate term-by-term
	\item Odd powers of $\sec$: Use integration-by-parts to integrate a $\sec^2$ term. For the resulting integral, replace a $\tan^2$ term with the Pythagorean identity, distribute in the integrand, and then distribute the integral across the integrand. One integral is the original, so that the original `loops'. Solve for this integral. The final integral is a power of $\sec$ two lower. Repeat this process until complete.
	\end{itemize}

\item Be able to compute other trigonometric integrals, often substituting trig functions in terms of $\sin$ and $\cos$, e.g. $\ds\int \dfrac{\sin(2x)}{\sin x} \;dx$, etc.

\item Be able to compute integrals with trigonometric functions with non-matching arguments using `looping' integrals, e.g. $\ds\int \sin(2x) \cos(3x) \;dx$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Be able to compute integration-by-parts integrals where one has to use IBP more than once, e.g. tabular integration.

\item Be able to recognize when an integral may be a `tabular integral', e.g. $\ds\int x^3 e^x \;dx$, $\ds\int x \sin x \;dx$, etc. This occurs most often when the integrand is of the form $\text{polynomial} \cdot \text{exponential}$ or $\text{polynomial} \cdot \text{trig}$. 

\item Be able to use tabular integration to compute tabular integrals, e.g. $\ds\int x^3 e^{2x} \;dx$

	\]

\item Be able to compute integration-by-parts where one has to `loop back' to the original integral, i.e. `looping integrals'. 

\item Be able to recognize when an integral may be a `looping integral', e.g. $\ds\int e^x \sin x \;dx$ or $\ds\int \sin(2x) \cos x \;dx$, etc. This occurs most often when the integrand is of the form $\text{exponential} \cdot \text{trig}$ or $\text{trig} \cdot \text{trig}$ (but the trig functions have non-matching arguments).

\item Be able to use tabular integration to compute `looping' integrals, e.g. $\ds\int e^x \cos(2x) \;dx$
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth]{images/looping.png}
	\end{figure}
So that\dots
	\[
	\begin{gathered}
	\int e^{x} \cos(2x) \;dx= e^x \cos(2x) + 2 e^x \sin(2x) - \int 4 e^x \cos(2x) \;dx \\[0.3cm]

\item Be able to distinguish between integrals which require $u$-substitution, integration-by-parts, or both. 

\item Be able to compute some `shifting integrals' instead by integration-by-parts, e.g. $\ds\int x(2x + 1)^5 \;dx$ or $\ds\int \dfrac{x}{\sqrt{4x + 5}} \;dx$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{08/21, Thursday: Integration-by-Parts\label{08-21}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Know the integration-by-parts formula: $\ds\int u \;dv= uv - \int v \;du$, or in the case of a definite integral $\ds\int_a^b u \;dv= uv \bigg|_a^b - \int_a^b v \;du$.

\item Recall that the integration-by-parts formula comes from manipulating the product rule for derivatives, so it is a kind of `reverse product rule'.

\item Be able to use integration-by-parts to compute integrals. 

\item Recognize integrals where integration-by-parts may be appropriate, e.g. $\int x^2 \ln x \;dx$, $\ds\int x^2 e^{3x} \;dx$, $\ds\int \arctan x \;dx$, $\ds\int \ln x \;dx$, $\ds\int e^x \sin x \;dx$, etc. 

\item Be able to use LIATE and the `box method' to perform integration by parts, where\dots
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
	L: & Logarithms \\
	I: & Inverse Trig \\
	A: & Algebraic \\
	T: & Trigonometric \\
	E: & Exponential
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
One then creates a box and fills it in:
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{images/box.png}
	\end{figure}
and then applies the `rule of 7':
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.20\textwidth]{images/7.png}
	\end{figure}
One can then write down $\ds uv - \int v \;du$. 

\item Know that the idea of integration-by-parts (by LIATE or otherwise) is to choose $dv$ to be the `hardest' part of the integrand that one can actually integrate, i.e. to simplify the integral by `integrating out' the hardest part possible and hope the resulting integral will be simpler. 

\item Know that LIATE can fail but often `overgrabs', i.e. $\ds\int x^3 e^{x^2} \;dx$ and how to fix it in this case. But also know that LIATE can fail completely, i.e. $\ds\int \dfrac{x e^x}{(1 + x)^2} \;dx$, and know how to `fix' $u$ and $dv$ in the case where LIATE totally fails. 

\item Be able to compute integrals where one first has to make a $u$-substitution before applying integration-by-parts, e.g. $\ds\int e^{\sqrt{x}} \;dx$ ($u= \sqrt{x}$), $\ds\int \sin(\sqrt[3]{x}) \;dx$ ($u= \sqrt[3]{x}$), etc.

\item Know that sometimes one has to perform integration-by-parts more than once to compute a given integral, e.g. $\ds\int x^2 e^x \;dx$ or $\ds\int x^3 \cos x \;dx$, or that some integration-by-parts integrals can `loop back' on themselves, e.g. $\ds\int e^x \sin x \;dx$ or $\ds\int \sin(2x) \cos(3x) \;dx$. 

\item Know that the integrals $\ds\int e^{x^2} \;dx$, $\ds\int \sin(x^2) \;dx$, and $\ds\int \cos(x^2) \;dx$ are all `impossible'. 
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{08/19, Tuesday: $u$-Substitution Review\label{08-19}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Know that $\ds\int_a^b f(x) \;dx$ represents the net area `under the curve' $f(x)$ between $x= a$ and $x= b$, i.e. the net directed area between $f(x)$ and the $x$-axis between $x= a$ and $x= b$---area under the $x$-axis counting as negative.

\item Know that if $\ds\int f(x) \;dx= F(x)$, then $\ds\int_a^b f(x) \;dx$ computes the net change in $F(x)$ between $x= a$ and $x= b$, i.e. $\ds F(b) - F(a)= \int_a^b f(x) \;dx$.

\item Memorize the `elementary' integrals:
	\begin{2itemize}
	\item $\ds\int \# \;dx= \#x + C$
	\item $\ds\int x^n \;dx= \dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, n \neq -1$
	\item $\ds\int \dfrac{1}{x} \;dx= \ln|x| + C$
	\item $\ds\int \sin x \;dx= -\cos x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \cos x \;dx= \sin x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \tan x \;dx= \ln|\sec x| + C$
	\item $\ds\int \sec x \;dx= \ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C$
	\item $\ds\int \csc x \;dx= \ln|\csc x - \cot x| + C$
	\item $\ds\int \cot x \;dx= \ln|\sin x| + C$
	\item $\ds\int \sec^2 x \;dx= \tan x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \sec x \tan x \;dx= \sec x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \csc^2 x \;dx= -\cot x + C$
	\item $\ds\int e^x \;dx= e^x + C$
	\item $\ds\int a^x \;dx= \dfrac{a^x}{\ln a} + C$
	\item $\ds\int \ln x \;dx= x \ln x - x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \log_b x \;dx= \dfrac{x \log_b x - x}{\ln b} + C$
	\item $\ds\int \dfrac{1}{1 + x^2} \;dx= \arctan x + C$
	\item $\ds\int \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \;dx= \arcsin x + C$
	\end{2itemize}

\item Know when $u$-substitution might be appropriate: when one has a function one can integrate but is `off' by a factor whose derivative (up to a multiple) is in the integrand. For example, $\ds\int x e^{x^2} \;dx$. Here we know how to integrate $e^x$ but is `off' by $x^2$, whose derivative $2x$ can be found (up to a multiple) in the integrand, i.e. the $x$.

\item Know how to use $u$-substitution with both definite and indefinite integrals, e.g. $\ds\int \dfrac{\sin(\ln x)}{x} \;dx$ and $\ds\int_1^4 \dfrac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{\sqrt{x}} \;dx$.

\item Be able to perform linear $u$-substitution in your head, i.e. one should be able to compute integrals `like' $\ds\int e^{3x} \;dx$, $\ds\int \sin\left( \tfrac{x}{2} \right) \;dx$, $\ds\int (2x - 1)^5 \;dx$, etc. in one's head. 

\item Remember to always change your bounds when performing $u$-substitution with a definite integral!

\item Recognize the special case of $u$-substitution of `shifting' integrals, where one needs to solve for $x$ in $u= \cdots$, e.g. $\ds\int \dfrac{x}{x + 3} \;dx$, $\ds\int x \sqrt{x - 2} \;dx$, $\ds\int 4x(x + 3)^{10} \;dx$, etc.
