\sectionbreak



% Course Materials
\mysection{0.22}{Course Materials}{course_mat}

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}Textbook.} The textbook for this course is {\itshape Thomas' Calculus Early Transcendentals (15th Ed)} by George B. Thomas Jr. Students may purchase a physical copy of the textbook; however, a more convenient option may be to purchase an ebook version of the textbook that comes along with the course homework system MyMathLab. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}MyMathLab.} Students will complete homework and possibly other course assignments using a homework system called MyMathLab, which pairs with the course textbook. All students in the course will need to purchase access to this system for the semester. Instructions on how to create your Pearson MyMath account can be found in the `Homework' folder on Blackboard. If you already have an account, you merely need to login to your Pearson account using the `Pearson' link in the Blackboard `Homework' folder. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}SageMath.} To help students engage with the course topics and learn some fundamental programming principles, students will complete a series of labs using SageMath throughout the semester. SageMath is an open source program for mathematical programs that is built using Python. Students will not need their own copy of SageMath as the computers in their assigned lab have the program already installed. However, students may install their own copy or use an online version of SageMath through \textit{Binder}. Instructions for uploading a lab file to Binder can be found in the corresponding course `Reference Guide' and links to open labs in Binder immediately are provided in the third column of the table where the lab downloads are provided. If a student wants assistance obtaining a personal copy of SageMath, they can see the course `Accessing Sagemath' guide or make use of the technical resources available to them at the university. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}Calculators.} Basic graphing calculators will often be allowed during the course, unless otherwise instructed. However, these will not be required. The course may make use of the computational engine Mathematica via the WolframAlpha website: \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com}. Although WolframAlpha does have a paid account option for additional resources, the course will not make use of these features and students {\itshape will not} be required to setup an account or make any kind of payment. The course may also make use of Symbolab: \url{https://www.symbolab.com/}. Calculators or other computational devices will not be allowed during exams. 
\sectionbreak



% Course Format
\mysection{0.19}{Course Format}{course_format}

The course consists of four meetings per week. Meetings on Tuesday and Thursday will focus primarily on lectures addressing the course material. Lectures will begin with a short checkin followed by course material. Whenever possible, these lectures will consist of a topic discussion followed by time for individual or group problem solving. However, due to the number and `depth' of course topics, not every concept or problem type can be covered during class. Therefore, you may be assigned reading or videos before lecture. Lectures where readings or video are assigned will still cover course content; however, the focus of these lectures will be problem-solving. Therefore, be sure to do the assigned reading/viewing before the lecture. Regardless, students are expected to spend outside of class reading course material, studying extra materials, and solving additional problems. Students are highly encouraged to do additional practice problems from past semesters available via the course webpage. Class meetings on Monday and Wednesday will be either a recitation or lab, both led by a teaching assistant---not the primary instructor. Recitations will typically focus on time for questions, review, and problem solving. Labs will typically occur on Thursdays and will either be used to take a Gateway exam or work on a Sage lab. A student should be able to complete a Gateway exam or lab in the assigned time. However, if a student does not complete the Gateway exam or lab during the period, they are still required to submit the assignment before the due date. Students may use the computer lab when it is available or complete the assignment on their own device; however, a student must be proctored to take a Gateway exam. Regardless, students should be certain to submit the assignment before the deadline---especially in the case of Gateway exams. Finally, students are expected to typically spend approximately 3 hours per credit outside of class on
course materials. However, some weeks this may be more or less.

        \end{tabular}
        \end{table} 
\sectionbreak



% Attendance and Participation
\mysection{0.36}{Attendance \& Participation}{attend}

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}Attendance.} It is essential to your success in this course that you attend each lecture and participate in class discussions. It is also a federal requirement that students who do not attend or stop attending a class be reported at the time of determination by the faculty that the student never attended or stopped attending the class. Therefore, you are expected to attend each lecture and to show up on time. Address any absence(s), anticipated or unanticipated, with the instructor as soon as possible. Should you anticipate an absence, you are to contact the instructor as soon as possible---at least twenty-four hours before the class, if possible. Certain absences from lecture(s) may be excused, depending on the reason for the absence. Determinations are made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. The student should discuss the issue with the instructor as soon as possible; however, to excuse an absence, the reason(s) for missing lecture(s) must be documentable and presented, if requested. \pspace

If you miss a lecture, you are responsible for any material covered, any work assigned, any course changes made, etc. during the class. Do not assume or expect the instructor to provide you with anything, particularly lecture notes, from the class(es) missed. {\itshape Five or more unexcused absences from lectures could result in receiving a grade penalty per additional absence or an `F' in the course.} Furthermore, excessive lateness will also count as an absence. If you are dismissed from lecture due to problems during the lecture, e.g. disruptive behavior or unauthorized cell phone use, then this dismissal will be recorded as an absence for the lecture. If you cannot attend a class due to illness, inform your instructor immediately so that arrangements can be made. In this case, the student may be required to participate in lectures virtually and submit assignments online. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{scred}Participation.} Students are expected to participate in the course---both inside and outside the classroom. Inside the classroom, this means attending class, paying attention, taking notes, asking and answering questions when appropriate, etc. However, course participation does not begin and end at the classroom door. Students are expected to review course material and complete course assignments. Typically, students can expect to spend approximately 3~hours per credit outside of class working for the course---although some weeks this could be more or less. Students are highly encouraged to form study groups to help support themselves and their fellow students' learning. These groups can be used to review notes or additional resources, work on class activities, discuss homework problems, etc. However, these groups {\itshape should not} be used to simply solve problems for others or have others solve your problems for you. For instance, students may not `assign' homework problems to each other to solve in order to complete assignments. Using study groups in this or similar manners is an academic integrity violation that will be dealt with harshly. If you are unsure if what plan on doing or are doing in study groups is appropriate, discuss this with your instructor. \sectionbreak



% Check-Ins
\mysection{0.18}{Check-Ins}{check}

There will be a check-in \textit{every} class. Check-Ins are meant to be short and simple. These check-ins serve more as a method of gauging whether you are keeping up with the material. It is important that if you are late that you obtain a copy of the check-in immediately. Check-In solutions will often be discussed following the check-in. Because check-in solutions will often be discussed in class, no make-up check-in will be given except under extraordinary circumstances determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. Unless otherwise instructed, there are no calculators, computational devices, notes, or outside assistance of any kind allowed on check-ins. 
\sectionbreak



% Labs
\mysection{0.18}{Labs}{labs}
Learning Calculus requires students to actively engage with course concepts. Furthermore, real-world applications of Calculus (and beyond) will require some level of programming skills. To address both these issues, students will be given a number of labs across the semester. These sessions will occur nearly weekly and be located in the Math Lab in LeConte Hall. Each lab is a series of guided problems using SageMath. SageMath is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It is built using Python and can be built on top of many existing open-source packages, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, etc. This serves as a free, open-source alternative to other mathematics software, e.g. Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple, Magma, etc. \pspace

Nearly every week, students will have a lab to complete using SageMath. These labs will help engage them with the material and learn some basic programming skills. Students will not need to get their own copy of SageMath---even though it is free and open-source. Each computer in the Math Lab has a copy of SageMath already installed. However, students may install their own copy or use an online version of SageMath through \textit{Binder}. Instructions for uploading a lab file to Binder can be found in the corresponding course `Reference Guide' and links to open labs in Binder immediately are provided in the third column of the table where the lab downloads are provided. If a student wants assistance obtaining a personal copy of SageMath, they can see the course `Accessing Sagemath' guide or make use of the technical resources available to them at the university. You may also find more information about this on the \href{https://sc.edu/study/colleges\_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/my\_mathematics/undergrads/calculus\_labs/accessing\_sagemath.php}{Accessing SageMath webpage} (\url{https://sc.edu/study/colleges\_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/my\_mathematics/undergrads/calculus\_labs/accessing\_sagemath.php}). \pspace

The complete list of SageMath labs for the semester can be found on the \href{https://sc.edu/study/colleges\_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/my\_mathematics/undergrads/calculus\_labs/math\_142\_labs.php}{Math 142 Labs webpage} (\url{https://sc.edu/study/colleges\_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/my\_mathematics/undergrads/calculus\_labs/math\_142\_labs.php}). While not necessarily encouraged, students may complete these labs in advance. However, whether a lab was completed in advance or not, students are still expected to attend their assigned lab. This is because the dates for labs may shift, other material may be addressed during labs, surveys may be given out during labs, and students should mostly only expect lab help during their assigned lab period. If a student completes a lab in advance, they can use the lab period for other homework, studying, or trying to write their own SageMath programs to answer other course problems. Each SageMath lab should be able to be completed during the assigned lab period. However, if a student does not complete their lab during this time, they are still expected to complete and submit the lab on time. This will likely mean the student will need to return to the Math Lab when it is open during their own time to complete the lab, complete the lab using binder, or use their own copy of SageMath to complete the lab. Do not hesitate to ask for help with these labs. Because the submission for these labs will likely be done electronically, do not wait until the last minutes or seconds to submit an assignment---anticipate unanticipated problems. Do not expect to have a late lab be accepted, certainly not without a grade penalty. Acceptance of late labs or any grade penalties incurred will be decided on a student-by-student basis at the discretion of the instructors. 
\sectionbreak



% Gateways
\mysection{0.18}{Gateways}{gateways}

There are two Gateway exams during the semester. The Gateway exams are 30 minute exams help ensure students have achieved mastery over the basic Calculus~I (Gateway~I) and Calculus~II (Gateway~II) skills required to succeed in future course material. Gateway I focuses on prerequisite material from Calculus~I, i.e. limits and differentiation, while Gateway~II focuses on the early integration techniques from Calculus II. Each Gateway exam is worth 5\% of the course grade. The Gateway exams are administered via an online system called WebWork---run through the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Students will not need to create an account. Instead, students will access the Gateway exam in WebWork through their Blackboard account. Students will simply need to click the appropriate link on their course Blackboard page. \pspace

Gateway~I is open from the first day of classes until 01/28 at 6:30~pm. Gateway~II is open from 02/17 until 03/06 at 6:30~pm. Each Gateway exam is graded on an `all-or-nothing' scale---either students achieve the minimum required score and earn 100\% or fail to achieve the minimum required score and earn 0\%. However, students have an `unlimited' number of attempts to pass each Gateway exam; that is, a student can take the exam repeatedly until a passing score is achieved. But a student \textit{must} be proctored to take a Gateway exam. Students can be proctored by their teaching assistant or by one of the staff in the Math Lab. Once a student has earned the minimum passing score on an attempt, they \textit{do not} have to make any subsequent attempts (though these may temporarily appear as a 0\% until the \textit{final} 100\% for the exam is processed after the Gateway exam period has closed). Students that fail to pass Gateway~I are \textit{highly} encouraged to enroll in MATH~152, which is a 1-credit hour support course called Calculus Workshop II. This is a pass/fail class designed to allow for more practice with the course material. Students who do not pass Gateway~I, enroll in MATH~152, and pass MATH~152 will not receive the 5\% penalty to their course grade. There are limited spots for MATH 152, so students wanting to enroll---whether they have failed Gateway~I or not---should enroll as soon as possible. Students not able to enroll in MATH 152 \textit{may} be offered an opportunity to earn back their Gateway I score. These opportunities are offered on a student-by-student basis.
\sectionbreak



% Homeworks
\mysection{0.18}{Homeworks}{hw}

The only way to learn Mathematics is to do Mathematics! Therefore, there will be weekly homework assignments. Homeworks will mostly be given and submitted using Pearson's MyMathLab. Therefore, students will need to purchase an access code to this system at \url{http://www.mymathlab.com}. Students can also purchase access to a digital copy of the textbook when they purchase an access code. Instructions on how to create your Pearson MyMath account can be found in the `Homework' folder on Blackboard. If you already have an account, you merely need to login to your Pearson account using the `Pearson' link in the Blackboard `Homework' folder. If you have difficulties in accessing this system, getting an access code, or using the system during the semester, ask your instructor, teaching assistant, or other university technological consultant for assistance. Because homeworks will often be submitted electronically and students may experience difficulties with these systems, the internet, etc., do not wait until the last minute to begin or submit these assignments. \pspace

It is essential for students to complete all of the assignments for the course. Working on homework is the best way of engaging with course concepts and gauging one's mastery of the material. Moreover, homework is an essential portion of the course grade. Assignments should be started as soon as possible. Do not delay working through homework; it is easier to keep up than it is to catch up. Students may request extensions on homework assignments. Requests for extensions should be submitted to the instructor in a timely fashion---do not delay! However, do not simply assume that you will be able to receive extra time on an assignment and plan your schedule carefully. Except in exceptional circumstances, homework extensions on topics included in an exam will not be granted beyond the exam date for that material. Any extensions, due dates, and grade penalties for late assignments will be determined by the instructor on a student-by-student basis. \pspace

You are encouraged to work with others on homeworks. Mathematics is a social activity! The purpose of working together on assignments is to engage with course topics, see different perspectives, ask questions, and have others look over your work. However, do not simply use others to do your assignments. You should also not allow other students to use you to complete their assignments. Of course, using online solutions is a violation of the university's academic integrity policies. If you are unsure of whether a particular resource is appropriate to use on an assignment, consult with your instructor first. \pspace

Homeworks may entail software or programming components. These portions may require a fair amount of independence on the part of the student. Should you have difficulty with these problems, ask your instructor for help! Be aware that many of your fellow students may be more technologically literate and ask them for help as well! Anticipate that there may be technological issues and always start problem sets early! Do not wait until the problem(s) are nearly due to try to complete or submit them. You are responsible for submitting solutions and any files for computer-based problems on-time and in the proper format. Always check the file(s) after submission. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in grade deductions or rejection of submissions. There is no guarantee that any late solution(s) or file(s) will be accepted. However, if you experience technical difficulties, document the issues thoroughly. 
\sectionbreak



% Exams
\mysection{0.18}{Exams}{exams}

There will be three exams in this course, each worth 10\% of the course grade for a total of 30\% of the course grade. There will also be a final exam worth 25\% of the course grade. Together, all exams are worth 55\% of the course grade. The schedule of the exams can be found in the `Course Schedule' section of the syllabus. However, these exam dates are subject to change. Students should not make plans to leave campus or otherwise have conflicts on/before class on Friday November 21st for Thanksgiving Break nor December 9th for the final exam. Exams will typically focus on that portion of the course's material. However, any course topics may appear on any exam. The final exam is cumulative and will cover the topics from the entire semester. Students should be present, seated, and prepared for a scheduled exam before the exam begins. Students who are late should not expect extra exam time. Furthermore, students who miss an exam should not expect to receive a make-up exam. There will be no make-up exams except under extraordinary circumstances, e.g. in the case of an emergency. However, determinations for make-up exams or other substitutions, with possible grade deductions, are made at the discretion of the instructor on a case-by-case basis. Unless otherwise instructed, no devices or materials other than those provided by the instructor are allowed on any exam. Exams may involve out-of-class portions, which will be submitted at a time and manner specified in lecture. Furthermore, it may be possible that any exam will be a take-home exam. In this case, the exam procedure and schedule will be announced in advance during lecture. 
\sectionbreak



% Respect Policy
\mysection{0.19}{Respect Policy}{respect}

Learning requires a healthy academic environment. A key component to this is respecting everyone's time, especially giving everyone time to fail, ask questions, and learn---including yourself! Therefore, everyone should abide by the following respect policies: \pspace

The instructor will respect student's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will come prepared to help you understand the course material and prepare students for quizzes/exams. 
	\item They will listen to student feedback on how to best help them succeed. 
	\item They will return assignments, respond to emails, and give feedback in a timely fashion. 
	\item They will be patient during the student learning process and will treat all students fairly.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep=0.3ex
\item Attend every lecture; it is easier to keep up than to catch up!
\item Be proactive about your success in the course. Do not hesitate or delay in asking for help.
\item Do not procrastinate! Begin your assignments and studying early!
\item Address issues immediately. Ask questions during class, recitation, office hours, etc. 
\item Focus on problem solving and when studying do not \textit{study} problem but rather \textit{solve} them. 
\item Work on developing good problem solving skills, especially writing up problems in an organized manner with proper notation. 
\item Form a study group! Working together will help you and others better understand the course material as you can work through different difficulties and offer each other clarifications on concepts.
\item Do problems! Reading through your notes is not enough. Seek out new problems and work through them carefully. When you are done, check your answer. If you are wrong, examine carefully what misunderstanding occurred and how to avoid it in the future. If you were correct, examine if there was a faster way, check to see if your solution `flowed' and was easy to read, and think over what concepts/computations were used and what `type' of problem was the exercise.

% Academic Integrity
\mysection{0.25}{Academic Integrity}{univ_academicintegrity}

As a partner in your learning, it is important to both of us that any assignment submission is a pure reflection of your work and understanding. Suspicions of alleged violations of Cheating---defined as ``unauthorized assistance in connection with any academic work'' and/or Falsification, which includes ``Misrepresenting or misleading others with respect to academic work or misrepresenting facts for an academic advantage''---will be referred to the \href{https://www.sa.sc.edu/academicintegrity/}{Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity} (\url{https://www.sa.sc.edu/academicintegrity/}). \pspace

You are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student's work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation. The first tenet of the Carolinian Creed is, ``I will practice personal and academic integrity.'' Below are some websites for you to visit to learn more about University policies:

Amendments and changes to the syllabus, including evaluation and grading mechanisms, are possible. The instructor must initiate any changes. Changes to the grading and evaluation scheme must be voted on by the entire class and approved only with unanimous vote of all students present in class on the day the issue is decided. The lecture schedule and reading assignments (daily schedule) will not require a vote and may be altered at the instructor's discretion. Grading changes that unilaterally and equitably improve all students' grades will not require a vote. Once approved, amendments will be distributed in writing to all students via Blackboard. \pspace



% Artificial Intelligence Policy
\mysection{0.28}{Artificial Intelligence Policy}{univ_artintel}

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, e.g. ChatGPT, DALL-E, Wordtune, Symbolab, Photomath, WolframAlpha, etc., has the potential to transform student learning at the university level---providing students with tools to enhance their learning. However, these same tools also have the potential to destroy student learning opportunities when used improperly (especially in violation of university codes) or by providing incorrect, misleading, or information. Students and Instructors are expected to exercise caution, to use critical judgement, and to abide by university policies when using these tools. \pspace

% Prohibition on Unauthorized AI Use
{\bfseries Prohibition on Unauthorized AI Use} \par
Students are strictly prohibited from using AI tools to complete or assist in any graded or ungraded coursework without the explicit permission of the course instructor. This includes, but is not limited to, using AI to generate content, answer questions, provide summaries, or modify existing work (whether the student's work or the work of others). Unauthorized use of AI tools in the preparation, completing, or submission---in whole or in part---of course assignments (graded or ungraded), e.g. discussions, homeworks, labs, projects, papers, exams, may be considered a violation of this policy. \pspace

% Prohibition on Academic Misrepresentation
{\bfseries Prohibition on Academic Misrepresentation} \par
Students using, presenting, or submitting AI-generated content as their own work without permission or citation is a serious violation of the university honor code and policies on academic integrity. Students may not submit AI-generated content as their original work, nor should they use AI tools to modify their work in a way that could misrepresent their own efforts and understanding. Such actions are considered academic dishonesty and will be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the university's academic integrity policy. If AI is used in student work, it should be clearly stated what tools were used, where the tools were used, and in what manner the tools were used. The use of AI tools must comply with the university's academic integrity policy. Misuse or abuse of AI tools will not be tolerated. \pspace

% Instructor Guidance and Approval
{\bfseries Instructor Guidance and Approval} \par
If students wish to use AI tools for any aspect of their coursework, unless otherwise stated by the instructor, they must first seek and obtain written permission from the course instructor. The instructor may provide specific guidelines on acceptable AI use and will determine the appropriateness of such tools in the context of the assignment or course objectives. Students are encouraged to consult with their instructors if they have any questions regarding the appropriate use of AI tools in their coursework \textit{before} using the tools. By adhering to this policy, students contribute to a culture of academic integrity and help to uphold the university's commitment to honesty and excellence. \pspace



% Attendance Policy
\mysection{0.28}{Attendance Policy}{univ_attendance}

The University of South Carolina expects its students to commit to their educations by attending class and participating in course activities. In assessing student attendance and participation, the University aims to ensure the highest academic standards while recognizing that events occur beyond the personal control of students or faculty. Different courses demand different approaches to assessing student attendance and participation. Therefore, subject to certain limitations described on the University website, instructors of record are responsible for determining the attendance and participation policies appropriate to their individual courses. These policies apply to all courses offered by the University of South Carolina, including synchronous or asynchronous online courses. \pspace

While instructors are not required to take attendance, they are encouraged to do so. Federal law requires institutions to document the last day of participation for enrolled students who fail to complete a course. If an instructor intends to assign a grade penalty for absence or a grade for participation the instructor must: inform students in writing how attendance and participation will be measured, particularly as such measurement goes beyond recording students' mere presence in the classroom for all or part of a class session; maintain current, verifiable records; take care to apply attendance and participation policies consistently and fairly for all students; and recognize that failure to comply could constitute grounds for a grade appeal. Instructors requiring attendance as a component of a student’s grade must distinguish between excused and unexcused absences in the written policy for the course. Excused absences may not be penalized in a student’s grade, and the student must be permitted to make up coursework missed due to an excused absence or to complete an equivalent assignment agreed upon with the instructor. Online courses, whether synchronous or asynchronous, are not exempt from this rule. In all cases of excused absence, the instructor of record must engage in an interactive process with the student to determine reasonable make-up work. \pspace

Students are responsible for satisfying the requirements for attendance and participation for any class in which they are enrolled, including requirements for notification and documentation of excused absences. Whenever possible, and as specified by the University documentation is required in advance of any excused absence. Students that are absent from class should notify any instructors for the course and the university about the absence and the reason for the absence---whether the absence is excused or not. Students should submit their absence(s) and the reason to the Office of Student Advocacy at \url{https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolina\&layout_id=77}. Instructors must allow comparable make-up work for excused absences. Instructors may also require make-up work to be completed within one week of returning to class. A list possible criteria for excused and unexcused absences are found on the University website. \pspace

The University recognizes that students may occasionally miss classes for legitimate reasons not rising to the level of a formal excuse. For this reason, course attendance policies may penalize unexcused absences in a student's grade only after a student's unexcused absences exceed a set percentage of the total classes that the student missed without excuse. Once unexcused absences exceed this set percentage, every unexcused absence may accrue a penalty to a student’s grade. For traditional lecture-based, face-to-face classes, the minimum percentage of unexcused absences allowed must be at least 5\% of total class meeting time---though there are exceptions described on the University website. Instructors have full discretion to set their own policy regarding the late acceptance of course work missed due to an unexcused absence. More information on the University Attendance Policy can be found at \url{https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_affairs/our_initiatives/academic_success/ombuds_services/our_services/class_absences/index.php} and \url{https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/policies-regulations/undergraduate-academic-regulations/\#text}.

You may also find policies and procedures related to Civil Rights \& Title IX, prohibited consensual relationships, etc. on the \href{https://sc.edu/about/offices\_and\_divisions/civil\_rights\_title\_ix/policies\_and\_procedures/index.php}{Office of Civil Rights \& Title IX website} (\url{https://sc.edu/about/offices\_and\_divisions/civil\_rights\_title\_ix/policies\_and\_procedures/index.php}). \pspace

As faculty, the instructor must report all incidents of interpersonal violence and sexual misconduct, and thus cannot guarantee confidentiality. Please know that you can seek \href{https://sc.edu/safety/interpersonal-violence/index.php}{confidential resources} (\url{https://sc.edu/safety/interpersonal-violence/index.php}). If you want to make a formal report, you can \href{https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolina\&layout\_id=25}{report interpersonal violence and sexual misconduct} (\url{https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolina\&layout\_id=25}) or contact the institution's Title~IX Coordinator, or one of the Deputy Title~IX Coordinators listed on the SAVIP website. You can also file a police report by contacting USC Police at 803.777.4215. \sectionbreak



% Mathematics Help
\mysection{0.26}{Mathematics Help}{univ_mathhelp}

Be proactive about your success in the course! If you need help, there are many resources available to help you. Your first primary contact for help is the instructor, teaching assistant, and/or supplemental instructors. If you are struggling, attend their office hours or send them an email. Do not wait to bring issues, course related or otherwise, to the attention of these instructors. While students may seek help from their instructors, teaching assistants, supplemental instructors, etc., especially during office hours, there are a number of resources available to you at the university. These resources include\dots
