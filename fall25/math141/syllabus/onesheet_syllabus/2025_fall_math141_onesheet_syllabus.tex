% Course Information
\mysection{0.27}{Course Information}{course_info}
\hspace{0.53cm} {\itshape Instructor Email}: \href{mailto:cm264@mailbox.sc.edu}{cm264@mailbox.sc.edu} \par
\hspace{0.53cm} {\itshape Course Webpage}: \href{https://coffeeintotheorems.com/courses/2024-2/fall/math-141/}{https://coffeeintotheorems.com/courses/2024-2/fall/math-141/} \par
\hspace{0.53cm} {\itshape Office Hours}: The instructor's office is LeConte 345C. The office hours are Monday, Wednesday, \par \hspace{0.55cm} and Friday from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and Tuesday/Thursday from 11:30am until 12:30pm. \pspace


% Grading Components
\mysection{0.27}{Grading Components}{grade_comp}
Course grades are determined by the following components: \par \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{table}[!ht]
        \begin{tabular}{lr}
	Check-Ins & 5\% \\
	Labs & 10\% \\
	Gateway Exams & 10\% \\
	Homework & 20\% \\
	Exam I--III & 30\% \\
	Final Exam & 25\%
        \end{tabular} 
        \end{table}


% Attendance 
\mysection{0.27}{Attendance}{attendance}
Attend each lecture and show up on time. Address any absences---anticipated or otherwise---with the instructor. If you miss a lecture, you are responsible for any material covered, any work assigned, any course changes made, etc. during the class. Five or more unexcused absences from lectures could result in receiving a grade penalty per additional absence or an `F' in the course. Furthermore, excessive lateness will also count as an absence. 
\pspace


%% CircleIn 
%\mysection{0.27}{CircleIn}{circlein}
%Students are expected to participate in the course using CircleIn. This participation consists of two components: weekly feedback and CircleIn Study Actions. Students need to submit weekly check-ins and complete a total of at least 10 specific types of CircleIn interactions throughout the semester. 
%\pspace


% Check-Ins 
\mysection{0.27}{Check-Ins}{check}
There will be a check-ins \textit{every} class, typically at the start of class. Because solutions will often then be immediately discussed, no make-up check-ins will be given (except under extraordinary circumstances). \pspace


% Labs 
\mysection{0.27}{Labs}{labs}
Nearly every week, students will have a lab to complete using SageMath. These labs will help engage them with the material and learn some basic programming skills. Students will have a designated lab time to work on these labs. However, if a student does not complete their lab during this time, they are still expected to complete and submit the lab on time.
\pspace



\newpage



% Gateways 
\mysection{0.27}{Gateways}{gateways}
There are two Gateway exams during the semester. The Gateway exams are 30~minute exams that will help students to achieve mastery over basic Precalculus (Gateway~I) and differentiation (Gateway~II) skills and help assure students that they are prepared for the future material. 
\pspace


% Homeworks 
\mysection{0.27}{Homeworks}{homeworks}
there will be weekly homework assignments. Homeworks will mostly be given and submitted using MyMathLab. Therefore, students will need to purchase an access code to this system at \url{http://www.mymathlab.com}. Students can also purchase access to a digital copy of the textbook when they purchase an access code.
\pspace


% Exams 
\mysection{0.27}{Exams}{exams}
There will be three exams in this course, each worth 10\% of the course grade for a total of 30\% of the course grade. There will also be a final exam worth 25\% of the course grade. Together, all exams are worth 55\% of the course grade.

% Course Schedule 
\mysection{0.27}{Course Schedule}{schedule}
The following is a \emph{tentative} schedule for the course and is subject to change.
