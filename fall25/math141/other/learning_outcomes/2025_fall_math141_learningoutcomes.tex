\begin{center} {\bfseries \LARGE MATH 141 --- Class Learning Outcomes --- Fall 2025} \end{center}

Here are some of the learning outcomes for each lecture. That is, after lecture, the homework, and studying, what students should know from each lecture. Though this list is not necessarily \textit{completely} comprehensive, the most important ideas/concepts are contained in each list. Students should be sure to feel comfortable with each bullet point before an exam. These learning goals are broken down by class date---with the class topic given. The classes are given in reverse-chronological order for ease of access to the most recent class. You may also click any of the hyperlinks below to jump to that date.
