% Question 1
\newpage
\question[5] The CEO of EducateU, an education research non-profit, gave the following statement:

{\itshape We here at EducateU are revolutionizing education. Because of our tireless efforts for years, we have found an equation for intelligence---to predict future success. We have discovered that the future income of an average student with IQ $I$ is nearly perfectly predicted by\dots
	\[
	I^{2/3} - \dfrac{14}{I} + 20
	\]
}
Explain what is mathematically wrong about the CEO's statement. \pvspace{1.83cm}

{\itshape The given `equation' is not an equation; it is a mathematical expression because there is no equality, inequality, etc.} \pvspace{4.87cm}



% Question 2
\question[5] Find an expression that gives the price of an item that costs $P$~dollars after it has been discounted by 40\%. \pspace

{\itshape After the item has been discounted by 60\%, only 40\% of its price remains. We know to find a percentage of a number, we multiply the number by the percentage as a decimal. But then the cost of the item is $0.60 P$. Alternatively, we know the 40\% discount is given by $0.40P$. We then need to remove this price from the price of the item, $P$. But then the cost of the item is $P - 0.40P$. Observe these are the same because\dots
	\[
	P - 0.40P= P(1 - 0.40)= P \cdot 0.60= 0.60P
	\]
}



% Question 3
\newpage
\question[15] Consider the system of linear equations given below:
	\[
	\begin{cases}
	2x + 3y= 5 \\
	4x - y= -11
	\end{cases}
	\]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Without explicitly solving the system of equations, determine if there is a solution to the system of equations. Be sure to fully justify your answer. \pspace

{\scriptsize \itshape We know a system of two linear equations has a solution if and only if the lines intersect. Observe that\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	2x + 3y&= 5 \qquad& 4x - y&= -11 \\
	3y= -2x& + 5 & -y= -4x& - 11 \\
	y= -\frac{2}{3}\, x & + \frac{5}{3} & y= 4x& + 11
	\end{aligned}
	\]
The slope of the first line is $m_1= -\frac{2}{3}$ and the slope of the second line is $m_2= 4$. Because $m_1 \neq m_2$, the lines are not parallel. Because the lines are not parallel, the lines intersect. Therefore, there is a solution to the given system of equations.}

\item Find the solution to the given system of equations. \pspace

{\itshape Using substitution, we solve for $y$ in the second equation to find $y= 4x + 11$. Using this in the first equation, we have\dots
	\[
	5= 2x + 3y= 2x + 3(4x + 11)= 2x + 12x + 33= 14x + 33
	\]
But then $14x + 33= 5$, which implies that $14x= -28$. Therefore, $x= -\frac{28}{14}= -2$. But then $y= 4x + 11= 4(-2) + 11= -8 + 11= 3$. Therefore, the solution is $x= -2$ and $y= 3$, i.e. $(x, y)= (-2, 3)$. \pspace

Alternatively, we can use elimination. Multiplying the first equation by $-2$, we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	-4x + (-6y)&= -10 \\
	4x + (-y)& -11
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Adding these equations, we find $-7y= -21$. But then $y= \frac{-21}{-7}= 3$. Using the second equation, we have $-11= 4x - y= 4x - 3$. But then $4x - 3= -11$, so that $4x= -8$. Therefore, $x= \frac{-8}{4}= -2$. Therefore, the solution is $x= -2$ and $y= 3$, i.e. $(x, y)= (-2, 3)$.}

\item Verify your solution in (b) to the given system. \pspace

{\itshape We verify that $x= -2$ and $y= 3$ satisfy both of the equations simultaneously:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	2x + 3y&= 5 \qquad& 4x - y&= -11 \\
	2(-2) + 3(3)&\stackrel{?}{=} 5 & 4(-2) - 3&\stackrel{?}{=} -11 \\
	-4 + 9&\stackrel{?}{=} 5 & -8 - 3&\stackrel{?}{=} -11 \\
	5&= 5 & -11&= -11
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $(x, y)= (-2, 3)$ is a solution.}
\end{enumerate}



% Question 4
\newpage
\question[15] Find the average rate of change of $f(x)= 2x^2 + 3$ on the interval $[-1, 2]$. \pspace

{\itshape \tsol We know the average rate of change for a function is the slope of the line through the graph of the function at the endpoints of the interval, i.e. $\dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$. We have $a= -1$ and $b= 2$, so that\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	f(2)&= 2(2^2) + 3= 2(4) + 3= 8 + 3= 11 \\[0.3cm]
	f(-1)&= 2(-1)^2 + 3= 2(1) + 3= 2 + 3= 5
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, the average rate of change is\dots
	\[
	\text{Avg. ROC}= \dfrac{f(2) - f(-1)}{2 - (-1)}= \dfrac{11 - 5}{2 + 1}= \dfrac{6}{3}= 2
	\]
}



% Question 5

\question[15] Consider the relation $f(x)$ plotted below. 
	\[

	\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}
	\]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Determine whether $f(x)$ is a function. Be sure to justify your answer. \pvspace{0.7cm}

{\itshape Yes, $f(x)$ is a function because it passes the vertical line test, i.e. every vertical line intersects the graph at most once.} \pvspace{0.7cm}

\item Determine the $x$-intercepts for $f(x)$. \pvspace{0.6cm}

{\itshape The $x$-intercepts are the points where $f(x)$ intersects the $x$-axis. These are $x= -5, 2.5, 9$.} \pvspace{0.6cm}

\item Determine the $y$-intercepts for $f(x)$. \pvspace{0.7cm}

{\itshape The $y$-intercepts are the points where $f(x)$ intersects the $y$-axis. This is $y= 3$.} \pvspace{0.7cm}

\item Find $f(4)$. \pvspace{0.7cm}

{\itshape Examining the graph, we see that $(4, -3)$ is on the graph. Therefore, $f(4)= -3$.} \pvspace{0.7cm}

\item Find the solutions to $f(x)= -5$. \pvspace{0.7cm}

{\itshape If $f(x)= -5$, then $(x, -5)$ is a point on the graph, i.e. the graph intersects the line $y= -5$. Examining the plot, we see the solutions are $x= -6, 5, 8$.}
\end{enumerate}



% Question 6
\newpage
\question[15] Let $\ell(x)$ be the linear function with slope $-3$ through the point $(-1, 7)$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find $\ell(x)$. Express your answer in the form $\ell(x)= mx + b$. \pvspace{0.5cm}
	
	{\itshape We know the line has the form $\ell(x)= mx + b$. We are told the slope is $-3$, i.e. $m= -3$. We now that $\ell(x)= -3x + b$. Furthermore, we know that $(-1, 7)$ is on the graph, i.e. $\ell(-1)= 7$. But then\dots
		\[
		\begin{gathered}
		\ell(x)= -3x + b \\
		\ell(-1)= -3(-1) + b \\
		7= 3 + b \\
		b= 4
		\end{gathered}
		\]
	Therefore, $\ell(x)= -3x + 4$ or $\ell(x)= 4 - 3x$.
	} \pvspace{4.55cm}

	\item Find $\ell(5)$. \pvspace{0.5cm}
	
	{\itshape We know that $\ell(x)= -3x + 4$ from (a). But then\dots
		\[
		\ell(5)= -3(5) + 4= -15 + 4= -11
		\]
	}
	\end{enumerate}



% Question 7
\newpage
\question[15] Little Susie hires a tax advisor to not run afoul of the law running her lemonade stand. The advisor finds that the amount of money, $M$, she makes $d$ days from now is given by $M(d)= 15d + 20$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Explain why $M(d)$ is a linear function. \pvspace{2.6cm}
	
	{\itshape A linear function has the form $y= mx + b$. We know that $M(d)$ has the form $y= mx + b$ with $y= M$, $x= d$, $m= 15$, and $b= 20$. Therefore, $M(d)$ is linear.} \pvspace{2.6cm}
	
	\item Find and interpret the slope of $M(d)$. \pvspace{2.32cm}
	
	{\itshape We know from (a) that $m= 15$. We know that $m= \frac{\Delta \text{ouput}}{\Delta \text{input}}= \frac{Delta M}{\Delta t}$. But then $m= +15$ has units of money per day. Therefore, Little Susie makes \$15 per day, i.e. she makes \$15 in sales per day.} \pvspace{2.32cm}
	
	\item Find and interpret the $y$-intercept of $M(d)$. \pvspace{2.4cm}
	
	{\itshape We know from (a) that $b= 20$. We know that $b= 20$ is the output when $d= 0$. But then at $d= 0$, the amount of money is $M= 20$. Therefore, Little Susie has already made \$20 running her stand by the time she hires the tax advisor.} \pvspace{2.32cm}
	\end{enumerate} 



% Question 8
\newpage
\question[15] A physicist is examining the effect of finite heat pulses in a metal rod. They find that after the rod is subjected to a finite heat pulse that the temperature increases at a constant rate of 15$^\circ$F per minute. The initial temperature of the rod is 70$^\circ$F. Let $T(m)$ be the temperature of the rod (in $^\circ$F) after $m$~minutes. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Explain why $T(m)$ is linear. \pvspace{2cm}
	
	{\itshape A linear function has a constant rate of change. We are told that the temperature of the rod increases at a constant rate of 15$^\circ$F per minute. Therefore, the rate of change of temperature of the rod is constant. This shows that the temperature of the rod is linear in time.} \pvspace{2cm}
	
	\item Find the function $T(m)$. \pvspace{1.95cm}
	
	{\itshape We know the rate of change in the temperature of the rod is $m= 15$. We know also that the initial temperature of the rod was 70$^\circ$F, i.e. the temperature at time $m= 0$ (the $y$-intercept) was 70$^\circ$F. But then $b= 70$. Because $T(m)$ is linear, it has the form $mx + b$. But we know that $m= 15$ and $b= 70$. Therefore, $T(m)= 15m + 70$.} \pvspace{1.95cm}
	
	\item How long until the temperature of the rod is 250$^\circ$F? \pvspace{1cm}
	
	{\itshape If $m$ is a minute from now when the rod was 250$^\circ$, then $T(m)= 250$. But then\dots
		\[
		\begin{gathered}
		T(m)= 250 \\
		15m + 70= 250 \\
		15m= 180 \\
		m= 12
		\end{gathered}
		\]
	Therefore, the temperature of the rod will be 250$^\circ$F in 12~minutes.
