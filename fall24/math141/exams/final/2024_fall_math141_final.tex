\begin{questions}

% Question 1
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Santa missing Christmas would be a great crime, \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Help me dear students, before I run out of time!} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Showing all your work and using any method, compute the following limits: \par\vspace{0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $\ds\lim_{x \to 2} \dfrac{x^2 + x - 6}{x - 2}$ \vfill
	\item $\ds\lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{3 - \sqrt{h + 9}}{h}$ \vfill
	\item $\ds\lim_{a \to 0} \dfrac{3a}{\sin(4a)}$ \vfill
	
	\newpage
	
	\item $\ds\lim_{b \to \infty} \left(1 + \dfrac{2}{b} \right)^b$ \vfill
	\item $\ds\lim_{y \to \infty} \dfrac{3y^2 - 4y + 9}{6y^2 + 5y - 1}$ \vfill
	\end{enumerate}



% Question 2
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Rudolph's math looked quite queer, and Santa's in doubt. \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Did you check the derivative? Help me figure it out!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Use the definition of the derivative to find $f'(x)$, where $f(x)= 2x - 3x^2$. You may \textit{\textbf{not}} use derivative shortcuts to find $f'(x)$. \textit{\textbf{Do not}} use l'H\^opital's rule to compute any limits.



% Question 3
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Santa's sleigh is on point, but his math's in a tizz, \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Quick, take these derivatives---I can't lose my rizz!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Showing all your work, compute the following derivatives---\textit{do not simplify your results}:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $\dfrac{d}{dx} \big( \log_6(x) - \arcsin x + \sec x \big)=$ \vfill
	\item $\dfrac{d}{dx} \left(x^5 \, 2^x \ln x \right)=$ \vfill
	\item $\dfrac{d}{dx}\, \sin^2(1 - e^x)=$ \vfill
	\item $\dfrac{d}{dx} \left( \dfrac{x - \tan^{-1} x}{1 + \cos x} \right)=$ \vfill
	\end{enumerate}



% Question 4
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Santa's sleigh is in motion, but the curve's hard to trace, \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Find the tangent for me---I'm racing through space!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Consider the curve $\mathcal{C}$ given by $xy + y^2= 6$. Showing all your work, find the tangent line to $\mathcal{C}$ at the point $(5, 1)$.



% Question 5
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Oh no, Elone has taken to Y---mischief his goal, \par \phantom{(XX points)} But Santa saw through it and stuffed his stocking with coal.} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Elone fires a missile at Santa in retaliation as Santa flies overhead. At this instant, Santa is 8 miles due south of Eloneâ€™s SpaceY base, traveling directly south at 70 mph. The missile, having missed, is 6 miles due east of the base, traveling eastward at 60 mph. How fast is the distance between Santa and the missile changing at this moment?



% Question 6
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Santa's workshop is booming, but expenses are a fright. \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Help me minimize costs, or I'm bankrupt tonight!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

A rectangular gift shipping container must have an open top and a volume of 450~cubic meters. The container must also be three times as long as it is wide. Through Christmas magic, the cost of materials for the base is \$1 per square meter, while the material for the sides costs \$2 per square meter. Showing all your work, find the dimensions of the shipping container having minimal cost. {\itshape You do not need to prove that your dimensions give the minimum cost.}



% Question 7
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Stuck on a slope, the math's in a twist, \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Help me analyze the derivative or gifts will be missed!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Below is the plot of the \textit{\textbf{derivative of a function, $f'(x)$}}. {\bfseries This is \textit{not} the graph of $f(x)$.} 
	\[
	\fbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,every node/.style={scale=0.5}]
	\begin{axis}[
	grid=both,
	axis lines=middle,
	ticklabel style= {fill= blue!5!white},
	xmin= -4.5, xmax=4.5,
	ymin= -8.5, ymax=8.5,
	xtick= {-5,-4,...,5},
	ytick= {-8,-6,...,8},
	minor tick = {-10,-9,...,10},

	\node at (3.4,-1.9) {\LARGE$f'(x)$};
	\addplot[thick, samples=100, smooth, domain= -3:4.2] ({x},{1/5*x^2*(x + 2)*(x - 2)*(x - 3)});
	\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}
	\]
Based on the plot above, answer the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Identify the intervals where $f(x)$ is increasing and decreasing. \vfill
	\item Classify the $x$-values of any local maxima or local minima for $f(x)$. \vfill
	\item Is $f(x)$ concave up, down, or neither on the interval $(0, 1)$? Justify your answer. \vfill
	\end{enumerate}



% Question 8
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Addressing Christmas challenges, Santa has another request. \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Help me solve this problem---then we'll pass this tough test!''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Let $\displaystyle g(x)= \int_0^x f(t) \;dt$, where $f(t)$ is the function whose graph on the interval $[0, 9]$ is shown below. 
	\[
	\fbox{
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8,every node/.style={scale=0.5}]
	\begin{axis}[
	grid=both,
	axis lines=middle,
	ticklabel style= {fill= blue!5!white},
	xmin= -1.5, xmax=9.5,
	ymin= -5.5, ymax=5.5,
	xtick= {-2,-1,...,10},
	ytick= {-6,-5,...,6},
	minor tick = {-10,-9,...,10},
	xlabel= \(t\), ylabel= \(y\)

	\addplot[line width=0.04cm, samples=4, smooth, domain= 0:2] {4};
	\addplot[line width=0.04cm, samples=4, smooth, domain= 2:6] {8 - 2*x};
	\addplot[line width=0.04cm, samples=4, smooth, domain= 6:9] {2*x - 16};
	
	\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}
	\]

Let $f(x)= 2x - 3x^{2/3}$. Showing all your work, find the absolute maxima and minima of $f(x)$ on the interval $[-1, 3]$. Be sure to justify your answers with an appropriate derivative test. 



% Question 10
\newpage
\question[15] {\itshape Christmas almost over, you're nearly clear. \par \phantom{(XX points)} ``Help me find these integrals, then we're done for this year.''} \par\vspace{0.3cm}

Showing all your work, compute the following: \par\vspace{0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
